Hospital ER Analytics Database

A SQL-Based Healthcare Data System for ER Operations & Analytics

Author: Amy Sauden
Technologies: SQL Server, ERD Design, Data Modelling, Analytics Views, Role-Based Security

🚑 Overview

This project is a complete SQL-based healthcare data system designed to represent how an Emergency Room (ER) manages patients, visits, diagnoses, insurance providers, and staff activity. The database uses a fully normalized relational schema, synthetic data, analytical reporting views, and role-based access controls inspired by real HIPAA-style environments.

The goal is to provide a clean, connected, analytics-ready dataset that reflects real-world hospital workflows and supports insights such as billing, patient history, staff workload, and diagnosis costs.

🧠 Purpose of the Project

This project models real ER healthcare operations within a structured SQL environment. It supports consistent tracking of patient visits, billing workflows, diagnosis information, staff assignments, and insurance relationships. The system reflects how hospitals, clinics, and pharmacy benefit systems structure their operational data.

🗂️ Key Features

Normalized Healthcare Data Model for patients, staff, diagnoses, insurance, and visits

Analytics-Ready SQL Views (patient visit history + staff performance)

Synthetic Data Generation for realistic ER workflow simulation

Role-Based Access Control (Admin, Limited, Read-Only)

Clean Architecture matching real EHR and claims systems

🧱 Database Tables

The database includes the following entities:

Table	Description
Insurance	Stores insurance provider information
Patient	Patient demographics and insurance linkage
Staff	ER personnel and roles
Diagnosis	Medical conditions and billing charges
Visit	Central fact table linking patient, staff, diagnosis, and timestamp

A full data dictionary is available in the documentation.

🛠️ How to Run This Project
1️⃣ Create the Database
CREATE DATABASE ER_Hospital;
GO
USE ER_Hospital;

2️⃣ Run the Schema File

01_database_schema.sql
✔ Creates all tables and relationships

3️⃣ Load Sample Data

02_insert_data.sql
✔ Populates synthetic patient, staff, diagnosis, insurance, and visit records

4️⃣ Create Reporting Views

03_analytics_views.sql
✔ Builds:

PatientVisitReport

StaffActivitySummary

5️⃣ Configure Security

04_security_roles.sql
✔ Adds Admin, Limited-Access, and Read-Only accounts

6️⃣ Start Querying
SELECT * FROM PatientVisitReport;
SELECT * FROM StaffActivitySummary;

🔍 Analytics Views Included
PatientVisitReport

Combines patient, staff, insurance, diagnosis, and cost information for complete visit-level analysis.

StaffActivitySummary

Summarizes total visits handled and total revenue generated by each staff member.

🔐 Security & Access Controls

Simulated healthcare-style permissions:

Admin — full access to database

Limited User — can insert & select

Read-Only User — can view data only

🛠️ Future Enhancements

Medication/Treatment tables

Billing & claim submission logic
